    <p> Internet concepts is a global communication system that links together thousands of individual networks.
        In other words, internet is a collection of interlinked computer networks, connected by copper wires, fiber-optic cables,
        wireless connections, etc. As a result, a computer can virtually connect to other computers in any network.</p>

            <h4><b>IoT − Key Features</b></h4>
            <h5>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h5><br>
            <p>The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active
            engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below:</p><br>
            <p>1.AI – IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect
                of life with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks.
                This can mean something as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect
                when milk and your favorite cereal run low, and to then place an order with your preferred
                grocer.</p><br>
            <p>2.Connectivity – New enabling technologies for networking, and specifically IoT
            networking, mean networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks
            can exist on a much smaller and cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates
            these small networks between its system devices.</p><br>
            <p>3.Sensors – IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments
            which transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system
            capable of real-world integration.</p><br>
            <p>4.Active Engagement – Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens
            through passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product,
            or service engagement.</p><br>
            <p>5.Small Devices – Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more
            powerful over time. IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision,
            scalability, and versatility.</p><br>
            <p><b>IoT − Advantages</b></p>
            <h6>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h6><br>                    
            <p>The advantages of IoT span across every area of lifestyle and business. Here is a list of some of
                the advantages that IoT has to offer:
                </p><br>
            <p>1.Improved Customer Engagement – Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and
                significant flaws in accuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely
                transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.</p><br>
            <p>2.Technology Optimization – The same technologies and data which improve the
                customer experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to
                technology. IoT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.</p><br>
            <p>3.Reduced Waste – IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us
                superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to more effective
                management of resources.</p><br>
            <p>4.Enhanced Data Collection – Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its
                design for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces, and places it exactly where
                humans really want to go to analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.</p><br>
