Introduction to the module:<br>
1. Internet concepts=internet concepts is a global communication system that links together thousands of individual networks. In other words, internet is a collection of interlinked computer networks, connected by copper wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless connections, etc. As a result, a computer can virtually connect to other computers in any network.<br>
2. Browser=A browser is an application program that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web. This includes Web pages, videos and images.<br>
3. HTTP=Full form of http is hypertext transfer protocol. HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data over the web. It is part of the Internet protocol suite and defines commands and services used for transmitting webpage data.<br>
4. HTTPS=Full form of https is hypertext transfer protocol secured. The secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.<br>
5. WWW=Full Form of WWW is World Wide Web. World Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet. These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc. Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their devices such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc. The WWW, along with internet, enables the retrieval and display of text and media to your device.<br>
6. URL=URI stands for Uniform resources identifiers. It is define as a sequence of characters that distinguishes one resource from another.<br>
Note: A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a persistent and location-independent identifier that follows the “urn” scheme. In this context, “persistent” means that the URN persists in identifying the same resource over time. Here’s an example of a URN provided by the RFC 3986: urn:oasis:names:specification:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1.2<br>
i.URL=Uniform resources Locator is full form of URL. A specific type of identifier that not only identifies the resource but tells you how to access it or where it’s located. For example, a URL might contain ftp:// or https://. This tells you that the resource can be located and accessed via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).<br>
ii.URN=A URN (Uniform Resource Name) is an Internet resource with a name that, unlike a URL, has persistent significance - that is, the owner of the URN can expect that someone else (or a program) will always be able to find the resource. A frequent problem in using the Web is that Web content is sometimes moved to a new site or a new page on the same site. Since links are made using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), they no longer work when content is moved. A URN looks something like a URL. For example, here's a hypothetical URN:urn:def://blue_laser<br>
7. Search engine: A search engine is a software program that helps people find the information they are looking for online using keywords or phrases.<br>
<br>
Day 2:<br>
1.Web server=A web server refers to the software that provides its users with the documents they request via their web browsers.<br>
2.Domain Registration=the act of reserving a name on the Internet for a certain period, usually one year. It is important to know that this domain will remain yours for as long as you renew it and there is no way to purchase a domain name forever.<br>
