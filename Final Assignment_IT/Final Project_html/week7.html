        Paragraph Tag<br><br>
The p tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of
text should go in between an opening p and a closing  */p> tag as shown below in the
example:<br><br>

Line Break Tag<br><br>
Whenever you use the *br /> element, anything following it starts from the next line. This
tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as
there is nothing to go in between them.<br><br>
The *br /> tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash. If you omit this
space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss the forward
slash character and just use *br> it is not valid in XHTML
