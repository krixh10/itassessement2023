    <p><b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b><br>
        The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the evolutionary stage of the internet, which
makes a global communicating infrastructure between humans and machines. <br>IoT is
constructing the global infrastructure which will change the fundamental aspects of our
lives, from health services to manufacturing, from agriculture to mining.<br> IoT will offer
the necessary facilities of the latest rising artificial intelligence (AI) development. <br>This
chapter discusses the overview, characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, common
uses, security, trust, privacy and functional view of IoT.<br> Furthermore, this chapter
proposes application areas of IoT in detail.<br>
IoT has grown to be a marketing trend and general news piece. Beyond exaggeration, IoT appeared as a powerful technique with appliances in numerous domains.
IoT has origins in multiple former methods: sensor networks, embedded systems and
pervasive informatics. Many IoT devices are linked mutually to develop specific
purpose schemes; in the global network, they are rarely utilized as public access
devices.<br><br><br>
An IoT node is a sensor contained hardware piece that broadcasts sensed
information to users or any other devices over the internet. IoT nodes embed into
industrial equipment, mobile and medical instruments, wireless sensors, and more.
Top examples of IoTs are connected smart city, smart industry, smart transport,
smart buildings [1], smart energy, smart manufacturing, smart environment monitoring, smart living, smart health, smart food and water monitoring. Figure 1.1
shows the IoT network architecture. This architecture has a lot of IoT sensors for
sensing purposes such as temperature, humidity, pressure etc. After sensing, these
data are transmitted to a cloud server via an IoT gateway. Furthermore, users can
access these data through mobile apps and so on.<br><br>
Due to the accessibility of low cost and smart devices, the IoT network refers to a
smart system. IoT devices operate independently with their hearing and transmissionabilities.<br><br>
 Furthermore, the propagation of IoT provides a lot of benefits but also
provides potential threats. An overlooked factor so far is the rise in energy
expenditure. IoT nodes are anticipated to always be accessible on other nodes.
IoT offers a lot of benefits, including:<br><br>
Locating and tracing abilities: Customers should be capable of tracking the
nodes and locating them in a short amount of time.<br><br>
• Ubiquitous information swap: In IoT where nodes are linked to the internet
and where information is transmitted. Ubiquitous means intelligence.
Therefore, intelligence sensors collect information and transmit it using a
prearranged input.<br><br>
• Enhanced power solution: Customers should be capable of tracking even the
strongest node, and the customer should be capable of obtaining the best
result.<br><br>
• Data and intelligence management: IoT does not always require providing
commands to the instrument; where the node gives intelligence and information previously it can start working and obtains decisions and discovers
solutions based on intelligence.<br><br>
• Scalability: IoT should be the measurability, as with any number of IoT
nodes above an extensive network all nodes should distinguish uniquely.
Also, numerous significant IoT problems can be identified. These open problems
make it clear that the complexity of internet design currently needs significant
capabilities to alter.<br><br>
• Unprotected authorization/authentication: The administrator usually presents
authentication to verify the customer identity, and the authorization utilizes
rewriting or modifying the content for that appliance and the consent that the
administrator will give.<br><br>
• The technology of server: The number of IoT nodes over the IoT field
increases the demand and the number of IoT node replies, moreover increases
simultaneously depending entirely on the server where customers use the interface. The server response to the IoT node demand should be made
immediately. There must be no delay in responding to the customer.<br><br>
• Management of storage: A massive quantity of information is created. When
connected IoT nodes have a massive quantity of multimedia data transmitted,
they have big data and other types of inconsistent files where data is held
concerning these IoT nodes, these files do not take much space. Still, many of
them should be useable as soon as possible.<br><br>
• Data management: As transmission between nodes is completed, more
information is created daily between nodes, and there is more information
to be transmitted from one location to another. Consideration should be
given to whether specific information is transmitted or not.<br><br>
• Security: Provision of security can be challenging as the automation of nodes
has increased, which has generated novel security problems.<br><br>
